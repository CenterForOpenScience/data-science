This subfolder houses the R scripts needed to produce the monthly report on OSF Storage Usage.

The data these reports use is generated by [this python script](https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/osf.io/blob/50467ce8f156cea162666df6587614a7e95d4859/osf/management/commands/data_storage_usage.py).
The data and data dictionaries can be found [here](https://osf.io/r83uz/) (if you have the proper credentials)

To run this report:
* Make sure you have your osf authentication token set up an saved in your env file so osfr will work
* Open the .Rproj file in the ‘Monthly_Reports’ folder and then open the ‘distribute.R’ file in this subfolder in the newly opened RStudio project
* Run the whole script, which will pull in the raw data, create whatever intermediate datasets are necessary, render the Rmd file to the html report, and then upload that to the OSF project for distribution.
