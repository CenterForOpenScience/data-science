This subfolder houses the R scripts needed to produce the Quarterly report on downloads by product.

The main raw data for this report is generated by [this SQL script](https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/data-science/blob/master/SQL_queries/downloads_by_product.sql).
The data and data dictionaries can be found [here](https://osf.io/5hw9s/) (if you have the proper credentials)

To run this report:
* Make sure you have your osf authentication token set up an saved in your Renviron file so osfr will work
* Open the .Rproj file in the ‘Quarterly_Reports’ folder and then open the ‘distribute.R’ file in this subfolder in the newly opened RStudio project
* After launching the .Rproj for the first time, use `renv::restore()` to get the local project library on your machine. If you have already done this step before running the User_generation scripts in the same R session, you do not have to do it again.
* Run the whole script, which will render the Rmd file to the html report and then upload that to the OSF project for distribution.
